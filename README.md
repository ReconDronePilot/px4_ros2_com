# PX4-ROS2 bridge
First developped by PX4 dev team, then modified for personnal project.

src/exemples/offboard.cpp is the file used for the project.

This package provides example nodes for exchanging data and commands between ROS2 and PX4.
It also provides a [library](./include/px4_ros_com/frame_transforms.h) to ease the conversion between ROS2 and PX4 frame conventions.
It has a straight dependency on the [`px4_msgs`](https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs) package.
